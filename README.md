## Introduction

Graphics automation for volleyball matches.
If you are streaming a match and it's scoreboard is live on [DataProject's WCM](https://dataproject.com/Products/EU/en/Volleyball/WCM) you can automate the scoreboard and stats graphics.
It works for vMix and OBS.

Disclaimer: This version may not work with OBS, I started developing this to work with OBS but then started using vMix, so OBS support may be (and probably is) broken
